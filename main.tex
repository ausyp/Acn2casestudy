This case study attempts to discuss pre-operative and post-operative care required for an aged care resident who needs to under go total hip replacement due to a fall at home. In this instance the patient must have been presented to the emergency department post fall and escalated to the orthopaedics department from there. As the fracture would require immediate surgery there maybe significant limitation to pre-operative care. The discussion will include pre-operative assessment, patient education/information, surgery optimisation, addressing patient concerns, significance of multidisciplinary intervention in speeding up recovery, pain management and rehabilitation.
