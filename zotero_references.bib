	abstract = {Nowadays, fracture surgery represents a big part of the orthopedic surgeon workload, and usually has associated major clinical and social cost implications. These fractures have several complications. Some of these are medical, and other related to the surgical treatment itself. Medical complications may affect around 20\% of patients with hip fracture. Cognitive and neurological alterations, cardiopulmonary affections (alone or combined), venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, urinary tract complications, perioperative anemia, electrolytic and metabolic disorders, and pressure scars are the most important medical complications after hip surgery in terms of frequency, increase of length of stay and perioperative mortality. Complications arising from hip fracture surgery are fairly common, and vary depending on whether the fracture is intracapsular or extracapsular. The main problems in intracapsular fractures are biological: vascularization of the femoral head, and lack of periosteum -a major contributor to fracture healing- in the femoral neck. In extracapsular fractures, by contrast, the problem is mechanical, and relates to load-bearing. Early surgical fixation, the role of anti-thromboembolic and anti-infective prophylaxis, good pain control at the perioperative, detection and management of delirium, correct urinary tract management, avoidance of malnutrition, vitamin D supplementation, osteoporosis treatment and advancement of early mobilization to improve functional recovery and falls prevention are basic recommendations for an optimal maintenance of hip fractured patients.},

	abstract = {This prospective, randomized double-blind study, conducted over 19 months in a tertiary care ED, sought to determine if a fascia-iliaca regional anesthetic block provides better and safer pain relief than does parenteral analgesia. This study also aimed to determine the effectiveness of parenteral NSAID analgesia for acute hip fractures. Patients {\textgreater}65 years old presenting at an adult ED with acute hip fractures were randomized upon presentation to the ED into two groups (A and B) using numbers generated by the EPI-INFO™ (Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) program. The randomization list was kept by one of the authors who did not interact with the patients. Two groups of patients were to receive either (A) a fascia-iliaca block with bupivacaine and parenteral saline injection, or (B) the same block with saline and an IV NSAID injection. Upon admission to the study, vital signs such as blood pressure, mean blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and pain-intensity measurements [using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)] were obtained and repeated at 15 min, 2 h and at8 h. The occurrence of complications was registered. One hundred seventy-five patients were randomized, and 21 were excluded from participation. The remaining 154 patients were grouped as: group A (n = 62) or group B (n = 92). The mean pain level on admission to the ED for all patients, assessed with the VAS, was 8.21 ± 0.91 (CI 95\%: 6.43–9.99); in group A the VAS was 7.6 ± 0.22 and in group B 8.5 ± 0.72 (p = 0.411). At 15-min evaluation, values were: group A 6.24 ± 0.17 and group B 2.9 ± 0.16 (p {\textless} 0.001). At the 2-h assessment, values were: group A 1.78 ± 0.11 and group B 2.3 ± 1.16 (p = 0.764). At 8 h the VAS for group A was 2.03 ± 0.12 and for group B 4.4 ± 0.91 (p = 0.083). This study demonstrates that: (1) parenteral NSAIDs are very effective as analgesics after hip fractures in elderly patients, (2) fascia-iliaca regional blocks are nearly as effective for up to about 8 h after administration and (3) regional fascia-iliaca blocks effectively control post-hip fracture pain. (4) Fascia iliaca regional block has a rapid onset.},

	abstract = {Fast-track surgery, or enhanced recovery, has appeared in the last 20 years or so as a combination of the optimisation of clinical protocols ans organisational processes, pursuing the reduction in surgical stress with the aim of reducing peri-operative comorbidities, convalescence time, and functional recovery, resulting in a reduction in admission time. After a review of the European literature available on this subject, this article attempts to present an update. It highlights its interest and origins, basically being set out as a response to the question: ‘Why is this patient in Hospital today?’ It also attempts to summarise the essence of such programmes the search for immediate post-surgical mobilisation, being supported by a multidisciplinary approach. This includes a multimodal intervention and analgesia a limitation in the use of opiates, and the active participation by the patients in their own recovery. Furthermore, mention is made of the initiatives by European State organisation as a boost to enhanced recovery programmes in their respective countries, as is the case in Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom. The clinical outcomes published up to September 2015 have been reviewed. A subsequent decrease in mean hospital stay is observed in 11 studies, achieving patient satisfaction, low complication rates, a reduction in the transfusion rates, and with no apparent increase in re-admissions. Mention is also made of the financial consequences, and how to implement these programmes. As a conclusion, an analysis is made of the future challenges of fast-track surgery, such as the possibility of moving towards outpatient surgery or the obtaining of a surgery ‘with no risk or pain’ in general, for which there are still open lines of work.
Resumen
La cirugía de recuperación rápida, o fast-track, aparece en las últimas décadas como una combinación de optimización de procesos organizativos y clínicos, persiguiendo la atenuación del estrés quirúrgico con el fin de reducir las comorbilidades perioperatorias y el tiempo de convalecencia y de recuperación funcional, resultando en una reducción del tiempo de hospitalización. Tras la revisión de la literatura europea disponible sobre el tema, el artículo pretende realizar una actualización, poniendo de relieve su interés y orígenes, básicamente planteándose como una respuesta a la pregunta: «¿Por qué está el paciente en el hospital hoy?», e intentando resumir la esencia de este tipo de programas: buscar la movilización posquirúrgica inmediata apoyándose en un enfoque multidisciplinar, una intervención y analgesia multimodales, una limitación en el uso de opiáceos y una participación activa del paciente en su propia recuperación. Asimismo, se mencionan las iniciativas de organismos estatales europeos como fomento a programas de recuperación rápida en sus respectivos países, como es el caso en Dinamarca, Francia y el Reino Unido. Se han revisado los resultados clínicos publicados hasta el mes de septiembre de 2015, observando en 11 estudios una reducción consecuente de la estancia media, consiguiendo la satisfacción de los pacientes, unas tasas de complicaciones bajas y una reducción de la tasa de transfusiones, sin que aparezca un aumento de los reingresos. Se mencionan también las consecuencias económicas y la forma de implementar tales proyectos. Como conclusión, se analizan los retos futuros de la cirugía fast-track, como puede ser el posible planteamiento hacia una cirugía ambulatoria, o de forma más general la obtención de una cirugía «sin dolor ni riesgo», existiendo para ello todavía líneas de trabajo abiertas.},

	shorttitle = {Routine preoperative testing},
	doi = {10.3310/hta1120},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. To review the available evidence on the value of routine preoperative testing in healthy or asymptomatic adults. To assess the completeness of existing reviews of preoperative testing and how applicable their conclusions are to the UK. To identify areas for further research. HOW THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. The databases Medline, Embase, Biological Abstracts, Science Citation Index and HealthSTAR were thoroughly searched for relevant articles which were then classified and appraised. The databases of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (DARE and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) and the Cochrane Collaboration (the Cochrane Library) were also used to verify the completeness of the search. In this review, 'routine' tests are defined as those ordered for an asymptomatic, apparently healthy individual in the absence of any specific clinical indication, to identify conditions undetected by clinical history and examination. RESEARCH FINDINGS. No controlled trials of the value of the following routine preoperative tests have been published. All available evidence reports the results of case-series. CHEST X-RAY. Few studies allow the outcome of routine chest X-rays to be distinguished from those of indicated chest X-rays, and fewer have gone beyond abnormality yields to examine the impact on clinical management. Findings from routine preoperative chest X-ray are reported as abnormal in 2.5-37.0\% of cases, and lead to a change in clinical management in 0-2.1\% of patients. The effect on patient outcomes is unknown. Both abnormality yield and impact on patient management rise with age and poorer American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. The limited evidence on the value of a chest X-ray as a baseline measure suggests that it will be of value in less than 9\% of patients. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY. The findings from routine preoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) are abnormal in 4.6-31.7\% of cases, and lead to a change of management in 0-2.2\% of patients. The effect on patient outcomes is unknown. The proportion of abnormal tests rises with age and worsening ASA status. The predictive power of preoperative ECGs for postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiopulmonary surgery is weak. There is no evidence to support the value of recording a preoperative ECG as a 'baseline.' HAEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT AND BLOOD COUNTS. Routine preoperative measurement shows that the haemoglobin level may be lower than 10-10.5 g/dl in up to 5\% of patients, but that it is rarely lower than 9 g/dl. The routine test leads to a change of management in 0.1\% to 2.7\% of patients. Routine preoperative measurement shows that the platelet count is abnormally low in less than 1.1\% of patients, and that platelet count results rarely if ever lead to change in management of patients. Routine preoperative white blood cell count is abnormal in less than 1\% of patients, and rarely if ever leads to change in management of patients. TESTS OF HAEMOSTASIS. Abnormalities of bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are found in up to 3.8\%, 4.8\% and 15.6\% of routine preoperative tests, respectively. The results of these tests very rarely lead to change in the clinical management of patients. BIOCHEMISTRY. In routine preoperative tests of serum biochemistry, abnormal levels of sodium or potassium are found in up to 1.4\% of patients, and abnormal levels of urea or creatinine are found in up to 2.5\% of patients. Abnormal levels of glucose are found in up to 5.2\% of patients. These abnormalities rarely lead to change in clinical management of patients. URINE TESTING. Routine preoperative urinalysis finds abnormal results in 1-34.1\% of patients, and leads to a change of management in 0.1-2.8\% of patients. The only abnormality that leads to a change in management of patients is the finding of white blood cells in the urine. There is no good evidence that preoperative abnormal urinalysis is associated with any postoperative complication in non-urinary tract surgery. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives. To define the core elements of perioperative nursing. Background. To measure the nursing care intensity in operating departments and day surgery units, a consensus on the content of perioperative nursing is required. The core elements of perioperative nursing were initially defined based on literature and the clinical expertise of the national workgroup. Suggested core elements were verified in this study. Because healthcare systems constantly suffer from limited resources, while patients are legitimated and ethically justified good nursing care, it is essential to produce reliable information for resource allocation. Design. Descriptive survey using Delphi technique. Methods. The purposeful sample of 55 experts was invited to participate in the Delphi panel to evaluate the suggested core elements of perioperative nursing. Two nationwide Delphi rounds were conducted. The response rates were 89\% and 49\%, respectively. Content Validity Index was calculated for each component. Results. The Delphi panel accepted the suggested core elements that were seen describing the core of perioperative nursing. Conclusion. The initially defined core elements of perioperative nursing were verified in this study, with the core elements describing patient’s safety as crucial in perioperative nursing. Those concerning patients’ needs of information, communication with significant others, patients’ coping mechanisms and mental well-being or administrating basic care – for example hygiene – were not seen to be as fundamental as those describing physiological needs. Relevance to clinical practice. The results of this study can be used as an initial step when constructing an instrument for measuring the nursing care intensity in perioperative settings. In the future, the instrument may provide objective evidence of nursing care intensity and thus facilitate resource allocation. A further significance of this study lies in its potential to make perioperative nursing visible, so the nursing outcomes may be evaluated and proved.},

	abstract = {Increasing demands for hospitals to be more efficient mean that patients attending for an operation are generally admitted on the day of surgery. As a result, healthcare professionals have little time to talk to the patient to ascertain his or her wellbeing, to check for any signs of anxiety and ask whether the patient requires further information about the forthcoming procedure. Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to use appropriate interventions to identify and assess anxious patients. There are several instruments available to measure the patient's level of pre-operative anxiety. This article reviews the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale, which is easy for patients to complete and may help to identify which individuals need extra support.},

	abstract = {Background: Historically, the preoperative and postoperative care of patients with gastrointestinal cancer was provided by surgeons. Contemporary perioperative care is a truly multidisciplinary endeavour with implications for cancer-specific outcomes. Methods: A literature review was performed querying PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 1966 to 2012 on specific perioperative interventions with the potential to improve the outcomes of surgical oncology patients. Keywords used were: fast-track, enhanced recovery, accelerated rehabilitation, multimodal and perioperative care. Specific interventions included normothermia, hyperoxygenation, surgical-site infection, skin preparation, transfusion, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thromboembolism and antibiotic prophylaxis, laparoscopy, radiotherapy, perioperative steroids and monoclonal antibodies. Included articles had to be randomized controlled trials, prospective or nationwide series, or systematic reviews/meta-analyses, published in English, French or German. Results: Important elements of modern perioperative care that improve recovery of patients and outcomes in surgical oncology include accelerated recovery pathways, thromboembolism and antibiotic prophylaxis, hyperoxygenation, maintenance of normothermia, avoidance of blood transfusion and cautious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, promotion of laparoscopic surgery, chlorhexidine–alcohol skin preparation and multidisciplinary meetings to determine multimodal therapy. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary management of perioperative patient care has improved outcomes. Copyright © 2012 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Observations: Social and economic factors shape risk behavior and the health of drug users. They affect health indirectly by shaping individual drug-use behavior; they affect health directly by affecting the availability of resources, access to social welfare systems, marginalization, and compliance with medication. Minority groups experience a disproportionately high level of the social factors that adversely affect health, factors that contribute to disparities in health among drug users. Conclusion: Public health interventions aimed at improving the health of drug users must address the social factors that accompany and exacerbate the health consequences of illicit drug use.},

	abstract = {Background Diagnosing blood-borne virus (BBV) infection is an essential first step in eliminating transmission and securing access to treatment amongst substance misusers. Aims To determine the proportion of substance misusers presenting to hospital who undergo BBV testing and the factors influencing testing. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed of patients presenting to two Sydney teaching hospitals with substance misuse diagnoses between January and April 2015. Proportions tested for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C and hepatitis B previously and during the index hospitalisation presentation were examined. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine factors associated with testing. Results Of 239 patients, 47 (19.7\%) had a documented BBV at baseline. Of those with unknown BBV status, 29 (12.8\%) had undergone some attempt at testing during presentation; 3.1\% had their hepatitis B immunity assessed. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of testing during presentation included documented injecting drug use (odds ratio (OR) 15.14; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.21–54.50; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), admission under a physician (OR 11.79; 95\% CI 2.82–49.40; P = 0.001) and admission on a Friday (OR 4.46; 95\% CI 1.28–15.48; P = 0.02). Patients who had had more than one previous admission in the preceding 6 months (OR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.078–0.73; P = 0.01) or a length of stay of 1 day or less (OR 0.17; 95\% CI 0.032–0.87; P = 0.033) were less likely to be tested. Conclusion Despite the high baseline prevalence of BBV infections in the population, there were many missed opportunities for BBV testing. We found patient-, admission- and clinician-level barriers that could be addressed to enhance BBV testing uptake.},

	abstract = {Background This study investigates whether the type, nature or amount of polysubstance use can explain the increased risk of non-fatal overdose among people who inject drugs with severe psychological distress. Methods Data came from three years (2011–2013) of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS), an annual sentinel sample of injecting drug users across Australia (n=2673). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used on 14 drug types to construct five latent factors, each representing a type of polysubstance use. Tests of measurement invariance were carried out to determine if polysubstance use profiles differed between those with and without severe psychological distress. Next, we regressed non-fatal overdose on the polysubstance use factors with differences in the relationships tested between groups. Findings Among those with severe psychological distress a polysubstance use profile characterised by heroin, oxycodone, crystal methamphetamine and cocaine use was associated with greater risk of non-fatal overdose. Among those without severe psychological distress, two polysubstance use profiles, largely characterised by opioid substitution therapies and prescription drugs, were protective against non-fatal overdose. Conclusion The types of polysubstance use profiles did not differ between people who inject drugs with and without severe psychological distress. However, the nature of use of one particular polysubstance profile placed the former group at a strongly increased risk of non-fatal overdose, while the nature of polysubstance use involving opioid substitution therapies was protective only among the latter group. The findings identify polysubstance use profiles of importance to drug-related harms among individuals with psychological problems.},

Observations: Social and economic factors shape risk behavior and the health of drug users. They affect health indirectly by shaping individual drug-use behavior; they affect health directly by affecting the availability of resources, access to social welfare systems, marginalization, and compliance with medication. Minority groups experience a disproportionately high level of the social factors that adversely affect health, factors that contribute to disparities in health among drug users. Conclusion: Public health interventions aimed at improving the health of drug users must address the social factors that accompany and exacerbate the health consequences of illicit drug use.},

It explores the substances most frequently abused in the United States, the causes and effects of their abuse, treatment options, and the role that popular culture and the media have in shaping our understanding of these behaviors. Each book in this series follows a reader-friendly question-and-answer format that anticipates readers' needs and concerns. Prevalent myths and misconceptions are identified and dispelled, and a collection of case studies illustrates key concepts and issues through relatable stories and insightful recommendations. The book also includes a section on health literacy, equipping teens and young adults with practical tools and strategies for finding, evaluating, and using credible sources of health information both on and off the internet--important skills that contribute to a lifetime of healthy decision-making.},

Aims To determine the proportion of substance misusers presenting to hospital who undergo BBV testing and the factors influencing testing. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed of patients presenting to two Sydney teaching hospitals with substance misuse diagnoses between January and April 2015. Proportions tested for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C and hepatitis B previously and during the index hospitalisation presentation were examined. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine factors associated with testing. Results Of 239 patients, 47 (19.7\%) had a documented BBV at baseline. Of those with unknown BBV status, 29 (12.8\%) had undergone some attempt at testing during presentation; 3.1\% had their hepatitis B immunity assessed. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of testing during presentation included documented injecting drug use (odds ratio (OR) 15.14; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 4.21–54.50; P {\textless} 0.001), admission under a physician (OR 11.79; 95\% CI 2.82–49.40; P = 0.001) and admission on a Friday (OR 4.46; 95\% CI 1.28–15.48; P = 0.02). Patients who had had more than one previous admission in the preceding 6 months (OR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.078–0.73; P = 0.01) or a length of stay of 1 day or less (OR 0.17; 95\% CI 0.032–0.87; P = 0.033) were less likely to be tested. Conclusion Despite the high baseline prevalence of BBV infections in the population, there were many missed opportunities for BBV testing. We found patient-, admission- and clinician-level barriers that could be addressed to enhance BBV testing uptake.},

	abstract = {Background
This study investigates whether the type, nature or amount of polysubstance use can explain the increased risk of non-fatal overdose among people who inject drugs with severe psychological distress.
Methods
Data came from three years (2011–2013) of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS), an annual sentinel sample of injecting drug users across Australia (n=2673). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used on 14 drug types to construct five latent factors, each representing a type of polysubstance use. Tests of measurement invariance were carried out to determine if polysubstance use profiles differed between those with and without severe psychological distress. Next, we regressed non-fatal overdose on the polysubstance use factors with differences in the relationships tested between groups.
Findings
Among those with severe psychological distress a polysubstance use profile characterised by heroin, oxycodone, crystal methamphetamine and cocaine use was associated with greater risk of non-fatal overdose. Among those without severe psychological distress, two polysubstance use profiles, largely characterised by opioid substitution therapies and prescription drugs, were protective against non-fatal overdose.
Conclusion
The types of polysubstance use profiles did not differ between people who inject drugs with and without severe psychological distress. However, the nature of use of one particular polysubstance profile placed the former group at a strongly increased risk of non-fatal overdose, while the nature of polysubstance use involving opioid substitution therapies was protective only among the latter group. The findings identify polysubstance use profiles of importance to drug-related harms among individuals with psychological problems.},

Opioid overdose deaths in North America have been rising largely as a result of fentanyl adulteration in the illegal drug supply. Drug checking is an established harm reduction intervention in some European settings but has not been broadly implemented or evaluated in North America. We are evaluating a pilot program offering drug checking for people who use street drugs in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Methods
Drug checking services were implemented at two locations in Vancouver between November 2017 and April 2018 using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and fentanyl immunoassay strips. We report on the findings generated by this technological combination during the study period.
Results
During the study period, a total of 1714 samples were tested. Of 907 samples expected to be heroin, only 160 (17.6\%) contained the expected substance, and 822 (90.6\%) tested positive for fentanyl. Of 256 samples expected to be speed or crystal meth, 225 (87.9\%) contained amphetamine or methamphetamine, and 15 (5.9\%) tested positive for fentanyl. The FTIR also found unexpected and potentially dangerous substances and adulterants other than fentanyl.
Conclusions
This pilot program has demonstrated the feasibility of drug checking for identifying individual drug samples containing unexpected or hazardous substances, including fentanyl. By identifying the range of adulterants and diluents and giving an estimate of their prevalence in different drug types, it has also provided information about the composition of the illicit drug supply in an urban North American setting.},

HIV prevalence is elevated in prison and this is due to the over representation of people who inject drugs (PWID). Yet HIV prevention programs for PWID are scarce in the prison setting. With a high proportion of drug users and few prevention programs, HIV transmission occurs and sometimes at an alarming rate. This commentary focuses primarily on drug users in prison; their risk behaviours and levels of infection. It also comments on the transmission of HIV including outbreaks and the efforts to prevent transmission within the prison setting. The spread of HIV in prison has substantial public health implications as virtually all prisoners return to the community. HIV prevention and treatment strategies known to be effective in community settings, such as methadone maintenance treatment, needle and syringe programs, condoms and antiretroviral therapy should be provided to prisoners as a matter of urgency.},

Although the particular substances targeted by such ap proaches have changed, the underlying approaches and dominant "no-substance-use" injunc tion has not. Despite the existence of "informed choice" approaches, throughout much of this period, evaluation efforts continue to be constrained by the limited dictates of "no-use" perspectives. A pragmatic alternative to contemporary "Just Say No" education is offered that strives to minimize potential harm resulting from the uninformed misuse of licit and illicit substances.

	abstract = {Traditionally the doping debate has been dominated by those who want to see doping forbidden (the prohibitionist view) and those who want to see it permitted (the ban abolitionist view).
In this article, the authors analyse a third position starting from the assertion that doping use is a symptom of the paradigm of highly competitive elite sports, in the same way as addictions reflect current social paradigms in wider society. Based upon a conceptual distinction between occasional use, habitual use and addiction, and focusing on the physical and/or mental dependency caused by the addictive use of a certain drug, we argue that marihuana, stimulants and anabolic steroid abuse—the most frequently detected substances in doping tests—satisfies at least one, often both, of these conditions.
A conclusion to be drawn from the authors' arguments is that the prohibitionist view is inappropriate for dealing with doping, as the severe sanctions attached to it will cut the doper off her/his social and professional environment, thereby risking reinforcing her/his addictive conduct. But the ban abolitionist view seems inappropriate as well. At first sight, it seems neither rational nor humane not to intervene when confronted with conduct which is highly harmful for the individual and upon which she has reduced or no control whatsoever.
Instead the authors' proposal will be to contextualise dopers' conduct within sport healthcare and see it strictly in relation to each athlete's personal background. Developing preventive programmes—implemented through person-tailored counselling and eventually treatment, rather than severe sanctions or the mere lifting of the ban—seems to be a more reasonable, and probably more efficient, way of conducting ‘the war against doping’.},

	abstract = {Aims
A universal Internet-based preventive intervention has been shown to reduce alcohol and cannabis use. The aim of this study was to examine if this program could also reduce risk-factors associated with substance use in adolescents.
Method
A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in Sydney, Australia in 2007–2008 to assess the effectiveness of the Internet-based Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis course. The evidence-based course, aimed at reducing alcohol and cannabis use, consists of two sets of six lessons delivered approximately six months apart. A total of 764 students (mean 13.1years) from 10 secondary schools were randomly allocated to receive the preventive intervention (n=397, five schools), or their usual health classes (n=367, five schools) over the year. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post, and six and twelve months following the intervention on their levels of truancy, psychological distress and moral disengagement.
Results
Compared to the control group, students in the intervention group showed significant reductions in truancy, psychological distress and moral disengagement up to twelve months following completion of the intervention.
Conclusions
These intervention effects indicate that Internet-based preventive interventions designed to prevent alcohol and cannabis use can concurrently reduce risk-factors associated with substance use in adolescents.

	abstract = {In adolescence, there is a complex interaction among physical, cognitive, and psychosocial developmental processes, culminating in greater risk-taking and novelty-seeking. Concurrently, adolescents face an increasingly demanding environment, which results in heightened vulnerability to injury. In this paper, we provide an overview of developmental considerations for adolescent injury interventions based on developmental science, including findings from behavioural neuroscience and psychology. We examine the role that typical developmental processes play in the way adolescents perceive and respond to risk and how this integrated body of developmental research adds to our understanding of how to do injury prevention with adolescents. We then highlight strategies to improve the translation of developmental research into adolescent injury prevention practice, calling on examples of existing interventions including graduated driver licensing.},

	abstract = {This article provides a new reading of the crossover between youth subculture and drug consumption, and seeks to demonstrate that drug prohibition has entered a legitimation crisis in social and political policy (Habermas, 1975). This article argues that contemporary drug normalisation is at the centre of the apparent failure of drug prohibition to understand and respond to the growth in oppositional messages derived from digital communication and the use of drug representations by mainstream capitalism to sell everyday commodities for profit. At the same time, UK and US newspapers have questioned the validity of the ‘war on drugs’ owing to political corruption and human rights abuses in Mexico, Afghanistan and Colombia. The article considers that drug normalisation has disrupted drug policy because intoxicants have become incorporated into everyday culture, and in particular youth subculture. Within the recent literature, young people's drug use has been theorised within a generalised framework of postmodernity. This article argues that drug normalisation theory is not a postmodern concept. It is a theory derived from the work of the Chicago School articulated by Alfred Lindesmith, Howard Becker and David Matza, who in turn influenced the UK National Deviance Conference and the subsequent CCCS theory of subculture. This created the theoretical opportunity to interpret substance consumption as a condition of normalisation separate from crime.},

	abstract = {Issues. To reduce the occurrence and costs related to substance use and associated harms it is important to intervene early. Although a number of international school-based prevention programs exist, the majority show minimal effects in reducing drug use and related harms. Given the emphasis on early intervention and prevention in Australia, it is timely to review the programs currently trialled in Australian schools. This paper reports the type and efficacy of Australian school-based prevention programs for alcohol and other drugs. Approach. Cochrane, PsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched. Additional materials were obtained from authors, websites and reference lists. Studies were selected if they described programs developed and trialled in Australia that address prevention of alcohol and other drug use in schools. Key Findings. Eight trials of seven intervention programs were identified. The programs targeted alcohol, cannabis and tobacco and most were based on social learning principles. All were universal. Five of the seven intervention programs achieved reductions in alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use at follow up. Conclusion. Existing school-based prevention programs have shown to be efficacious in the Australian context. However, there are only a few programs available, and these require further evaluative research. This is critical, given that substance use is such a significant public health problem. The findings challenge the commonly held view that school-based prevention programs are not effective.[Teesson M, Newton NC, Barrett EL.

	abstract = {Aim Substance use by young people has long been a concern of western society, but opinion is mixed as to which prevention approach offers the greatest benefit, and whether indeed there is any benefit at all. This paper reviews the nature of prevention programmes, the research evidence that underpins these programmes and the prevention objectives against which effectiveness is measured. The aim of this is to create better understanding of the elements that maximize programme effectiveness, what can be achieved by prevention programmes and how programmes can be improved. Findings There is a range of prevention approaches for which there is evidence of effectiveness. Some are classroom-based; some focus upon parenting; some have substantial whole-of-school and community elements; and some target risk and protective factors in early childhood. All, however, are based substantially on the social influence model. In an attempt to improve practice lists of effective programmes have been developed, but there are concerns about the science behind selection. On balance, there is consistent evidence that social influence prevention programmes do have a small, positive effect on drug use, but this then raises the question as to whether harm, rather than use, would be the more worthwhile target for prevention. Prevention that seeks to reduce harm has been demonstrably effective, but has found little support in some jurisdictions. Conclusion Research has created a progressively better understanding of how to optimize programme effectiveness and what can be achieved realistically by even the most effective programmes. However, further research is required to identify which, if any, particular approach offers greater promise. The effectiveness of harm reduction should be compared with more traditional abstinence and the additional effects of whole of school, parent and community elements need to be measured more accurately. Contemporary social influence prevention programmes are flawed, but the approach is still the best way of influencing drug use behaviour in young people as a whole. Evidence-based refinement is the best option for greater benefit.},

	abstract = {Through comparative socio-historical analysis of American school-based drug education, this review critically examines past perspectives and practices and how they shaped current pro grams. Among the key findings emerging from this analysis: Contrary to the popular belief that drug education began in the 1960s, its roots actually go back at least 115 years to the advent of compulsory temperance tnstruction. Although the particular substances targeted by such ap proaches have changed, the underlying approaches and dominant "no-substance-use" injunc tion has not. Despite the existence of "informed choice" approaches, throughout much of this period, evaluation efforts continue to be constrained by the limited dictates of "no-use" perspectives. A pragmatic alternative to contemporary "Just Say No" education is offered that strives to minimize potential harm resulting from the uninformed misuse of licit and illicit substances. A unique evaluative strategy designed to assess the effectiveness of thts form of "informed choice" or "harm reduction" drug education is discussed.},
